   abstract = {The trend towards increasingly deep neural networks has been driven by a general observation that increasing depth increases the performance of a network. Recently, however, evidence has been amassing that simply increasing depth may not be the best way to increase performance, particularly given other limitations. Investigations into deep residual networks have also suggested that they may not in fact be operating as a single deep network, but rather as an ensemble of many relatively shallow networks. We examine these issues, and in doing so arrive at a new interpretation of the unravelled view of deep residual networks which explains some of the behaviours that have been observed experimentally. As a result, we are able to derive a new, shallower, architecture of residual networks which significantly outperforms much deeper models such as ResNet-200 on the ImageNet classification dataset. We also show that this performance is transferable to other problem domains by developing a semantic segmentation approach which outperforms the state-of-the-art by a remarkable margin on datasets including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and Cityscapes. The architecture that we propose thus outperforms its comparators, including very deep ResNets, and yet is more efficient in memory use and sometimes also in training time.

   abstract = {Domain generalization (DG) remains a significant challenge for perception based on deep neural networks (DNN), where domain shifts occur due to lighting, weather, or geolocation changes. In this work, we propose VLTSeg to enhance domain generalization in semantic segmentation, where the network is solely trained on the source domain and evaluated on unseen target domains. Our method leverages the inherent semantic robustness of vision-language models. First, by substituting traditional vision-only backbones with pre-trained encoders from CLIP and EVA-CLIP as transfer learning setting we find that in the field of DG, vision-language pre-training significantly outperforms supervised and self-supervised vision pre-training. We thus propose a new vision-language approach for domain generalized segmentation, which improves the domain generalization SOTA by 7.6% mIoU when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. We further show the superior generalization capabilities of vision-language segmentation models by reaching 76.48% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark, outperforming the previous SOTA approach by 6.9% mIoU on the test set at the time of writing. Additionally, our approach shows strong in-domain generalization capabilities indicated by 86.1% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set, resulting in a shared first place with the previous SOTA on the current leaderboard at the time of submission.},
